Data Analysis on Weather Dataset using Python

# Introduction
Data Analysis is one major part that you must master before learning or diving into the machine learning algorithms section because data analysis is a process to explore the data to get a better understanding of data.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset we will use is a simple weather dataset which is a time-series dataset that stores the temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc on an hourly basis on different dates in 2012Load Dataset.

# Load Dataset
You have the dataset and open the Jupyter Notebook or you can also create a Kaggle notebook over there itself. The first step is to import the necessary libraries and load the dataset into a notebook.

# Answering Different Data Analysis Problems
Q1)To check if there are null values and drop them
Q2) To find unique instances of weather types
Q3) To rename column named 'Weather' to Weather Condition'
Q4)To find all records from data of when the weather was exactly clear ?
Q5)To find the mean temperature, wind speed and visibility?
Q6)To find the variance of pressure ?
Q7)find the number of times when the"wind speed was exactly 4km/h
Q8)What is the Minimum & Maximum value of each column against each 'Weather Condition
Q9) To display a pie chart of percentages of weather conditions (pie chart)
